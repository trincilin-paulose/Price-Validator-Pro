Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India,honda-motorcycle-scooter-india,HMC-SCI-1,Bykes,Honda,154000,140000,80,"Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India today announced a voluntary market recall campaign for its CB1000 Hornet SP motorcycle. Aligned with the global market action, certain units manufactured in 2025 are affected.

Due to excessive radiant heat from the exhaust system softening the painted seating surface, the change pedal pivot bolt may loosen and fall off while riding, which can affect gear shifting.","As a precautionary measure, the replacement of the affected parts will be carried out at BigWing Topline dealerships across India starting from January 2026 onwards. The replacement will be done free of cost irrespective of the warranty status of the vehicle.

This voluntary move is intrinsic to Honda’s pro-activeness, reinforcing its commitment to strengthen customer trust & confidence further enhancing ownership experience.

The company, through its BigWing Topline dealers will proactively notify customers via call / e-mail / SMS for inspection of their vehicle from today. Customers can also check if their vehicle falls under this campaign by submitting unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on Honda’s website (honda2wheelersindia.com). To avoid any inconvenience or waiting at the dealership, customers are requested to book their service appointment in advance as per their availability.
